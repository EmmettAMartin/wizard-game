# Welcome To Wizard Game!

**This is a solo indie dev project, so any and all help is very very much appreciated!**

*The Goal*: Create a simple 2d PvP game, played on one keyboard, where the players use spells and items to slay eachother.

This project uses a custom 2d Python graphics library, by the name of [NebulaTK](https://github.com/CTRL-ALT-OP/nebulatk). To install it, all you have to do is type `pip install nebulatk`. Both this project and [NebulaTK](https://github.com/CTRL-ALT-OP/nebulatk) are very much in development, so feel free to report bugs that you may find .

While you're here, go check out the [issues](https://github.com/EmmettAMartin/wizard-game/issues) page! There's probably something for you to do, and it would really help me out! 

If you have questions, email me at emmettmartin273@gmail.com.
