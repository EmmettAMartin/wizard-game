LORE: The Blue Wizard is named Wimzard, and the Red Wizard is named Womzard.
It all started when Wimzard and Womzard were having tea together, and discussing what their ideal tea was.
Wimzard enjoyed lemon in his tea, while Womzard preferred milk. Not only this, but Wimzard was more of a coffee person,
and believes that's where milk belongs. Womzard was appalled at this revelation, and the situation deteriorated from there.

Thanks to my friend, Sergeant_Ranger (Reuben), for helping me port NebulaTK into the game, and for helping me with some of the functions and code (and all of the projectiles).
He also made NebulaTK, and it's great! Check it out when it releases!

Thanks to my Sister, Madeleine, for helping me with the lore, and naming the characters.

Thanks to my friend, Rowan, for playing it with me, even when it was literally just 2 cubes and 2 bars at the top of the screen,
and to listening to my dev updates.

CONTRIBUTORS <3:
    dleggo, CTRL_ALT_OP.
    Without the contributors, this project would not be possible.

CODING PROTOCOLS:
Please use descriptive function names, even if they are long and annoying to type.
Please add function descriptions, and try to add preffered types for the variables that are being passed.
Please ALWAYS have a space before and after an equals sign: " = "
Try to not have too much complicated and very specific math, but I'm guilty of it too, so it's ok if you do have some.
If you do have complicated math with hard-coded values, then just make sure to add a description.
